# Traffic

An AI system that utilizes computer vision to identify and distinguish different types of traffic signs, including stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more, in photographs.

Download the [data set](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) for this project and unzip it. Move the resulting gtsrb directory inside of your traffic directory.

Inside of the traffic directory, run <code> pip3 install -r requirements.txt </code> to install this projectâ€™s dependencies: opencv-python for image processing, scikit-learn for ML-related functions, and tensorflow for neural networks.
